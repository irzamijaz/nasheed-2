    <h1>Nasheed</h1>
    <h2>'Burdah' by Mesut Kurtis (2007)</h2>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/e2FKXPzsT7E" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CmPf_uowc30/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Burdah" style="width:50%;height:50%;"></a>

    <p>An uplifting way to start the day. This song established Turkey’s Mesut Kurtis as a new star of the nasheed genre.
        With the lyrics taken from the Burdah, written by 13th-century Egyptian poet Imam Al-Busiri, Kurtis gives these much-loved verses a modern sheen with his soulful voice and smooth percussion. "Islam doesn't clash with art because Islam is art," he told The National in a 2015 interview.
           “The only thing we are doing in our existence here on Earth is discovering and getting inspired by creation.”</p>
    <h2>'Ya Adheeman' by Ahmed Bukhatir (2001)</h2>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/SuUwjxh8MLA" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/71hi9H6fZuc/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Ya Adheeman" style="width:50%;height:50%;"></a>

    <p>History will show that the Emirati artist is a trailblazer for the local music industry.
        Where 20 years ago, an international tour by an Emirati singer would be limited to the region, North Africa and maybe a London stop, Ahmed Bukhatir has been packing out venues from Australia and New Zealand to the UK and Canada. The Sharjah resident remains the UAE's most high-profile nasheed artist and the aching Ya Adheeman is a beautiful showcase of his style: understated, soulful and with lyrics that warms the heart.
        Ya Adheeman tells the story of a troubled soul who finally found comfort in faith: "My soul is brightened by a light in my heart/ When I praised the God of Mankind/ And my soul is cheered up and the tears are flowing."</p>
    <h2>'A is for Allah' by Yusuf Islam (2000)</h2>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/Rob3iU3y8R4" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rob3iU3y8R4/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="A is for Allah" style="width:50%;height:50%;"></a>

    <p>An absolute classic of the genre, which went on to become an essential teaching tool for Muslim families. A is for Allah finds Yusuf Islam using various letters of the English alphabet to highlight certain aspects of the faith.</p>
    <h2>'Allah Knows' by Zain Bhikha (2010)</h2>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/CuXHj1jQbvI" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CuXHj1jQbvI/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Allah Knows" style="width:50%;height:50%;"></a>

    <p>This tranquil piece of songwriting could stand up as a great ballad for any pop act.
    With Allah Knows, Zain Bhikha shows the healing qualities of nasheeds and how their uplifting nature reminds us that all difficult times will pass.
    "Some of the best songs that I have written were when I was truly inspired and felt close to Allah and thinking about my life," Bhikha told The National in 2013. "That is what people want to hear, something real from someone else."
